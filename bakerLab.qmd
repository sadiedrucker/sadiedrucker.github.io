For the Summer of 2025, I was accepted into Oregon Health and Science University's NIH-funded Dental & Oral Research Summer (DORS) Scholar program. I was hosted by Dr. Jonathon Baker, where I contributed to his lab's ongoing research on *Streptococcus mutans*. *S. mutans*, a primary contributor to tooth decay, adapts to environmental stress by altering its cell membrane composition. The Baker Lab investigates how *S. mutans* regulates this process, particularly the increase in unsaturated fatty acids, which enhances virulence and competitiveness within the oral microbiome.

During the internship, I was able to present a fifteen-minute oral presentation and a poster during the final research symposium. I was also given the opportunity to present my research at the International Association for Dental Research (IADR) conference in March 2026 (stay tuned).
